I haven't abandoned Common Lisp.  I use it as much, and like it as little, as I ever have.  Lisp is a collection of dialects. I wrote the books about CL because it's the standard dialect, but there is a good chunk of Scheme (specifically, T) in *On Lisp*. In both books I was careful to distinguish between talking about Lisp generally and Common Lisp, though I'm not sure how many readers notice this. 

Over the last 19 years I have used (in order) InterLisp, Franz Lisp, IQLisp, MacScheme, Lisp Machine Lisp, Vax Lisp, Common Lisp (Kyoto, Lucid, MCL, and CLisp), T, Scheme 48, and Arc. It's Lisp I like, not CL.  I think CL is pretty ugly and always have. My favorite dialect of Lisp is T, which was developed (mostly) by Jonathan Rees at Yale in the early 80s.  T is the language Common Lisp should have been. 

If CL is ugly, why do I use it and write about it?  Because Lisp is so powerful that even an ugly Lisp is preferable to using some other language.
