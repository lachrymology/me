- Stolen bases are almost never worth the risk
- Young pitchers should start as relievers
- Almost anyone can save 30 games
- Relievers should never get the huge payday
- I hate LOOGYs, but if absolutely can't live without one, then the Rule 5 pick is your best option
- Ideal: Two 16 team leagues.  Balanced schedules.  No interleague.  Top 6 teams in each league make playoffs. Worst 16 teams go into one division next season.
- San Pedro isn't some magical place where everyone is born with superhuman baseball talents.
- 162 games is too many -- 148 ideally, 154 maximally
- Homeruns are not the only expression of "power"
- A player who can place a bunt with pin-point accuracy would change the modern game (back into the game of the early 20th century)
- The most important thing in a baseball game is the out -- there are only 27 of them
-
