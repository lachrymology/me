- Stolen bases are almost never worth the risk
- Young pitchers should start as relievers
- Almost anyone can save 30 games
- Relievers should never get the huge payday
- I hate LOOGYs, but if absolutely can't live without one, then the Rule 5 pick is your best option
- Ideal: Two 16 team leagues.  Balanced schedules.  No interleague.  Top 6 teams in each league make playoffs. Worst 16 teams go into one division next season.
- San Pedro isn't some magical place where everyone is born with superhuman baseball talents.
- 162 games is too many -- 148 ideally, 154 maximally
- Homeruns are not the only expression of "power"
- A player who can place a bunt with pin-point accuracy would change the modern game (back into the game of the early 20th century)
- The most important thing in a baseball game is the out -- there are only 27 of them
- Ichiro is one of the top 15 or 20 outfielders of all time.
- Some players (Izturis) might be a victim of the culture of batspeed.  They need to channel Roy Thomas and make the goal to never hit a ball 200 feet ever.
- Posnanski is the best thing that's happened to sabermetrics since Bill James. 
- Risk reduction costs money. You want less risk? Pay for it.
- Pass on pitchers with a K rate of less than 5.1
- Pitching is 35.2% of the game
-
