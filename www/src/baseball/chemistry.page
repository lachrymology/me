## Veteranicity ## {#veteranicity}
The condition of being a veteran. That is, one providing leadership through the mere fact that he has been able to stay on major-league (although other sports besides baseball apply) rosters for more than 5 years, regardless of skill-level. Someone displaying Veteranicity is often accompanied by an unusually large contract based entirely on his perceived level of Veteranicity, Spunkitude, and/or Mentorosity.

## Spunkitude ## {#spunkitude}
The condition present in certain ball-players which is often valued far above their quantifiable contributions to a team. Spunkitude often presents itself in the form of a dirty uniform, bloody arms, nagging injuries, high K/BB rates, choking up, arguing calls, stolen base attempts, excessive diving, and low OPS. Very often, players exhibiting high-levels of veteranicity also display a propensity for spunkitude; although one does not follow the other.

## Mentorocity ## {#mentorocity}
A quality gained by all major league players (although other sports besides baseball apply) once they have achieved even trace levels of veteranicity. It is a fact that on the 5th anniversary of a given player’s inception into the majors, a long dormant leadership gene, present in all athletes, is essentially switched on thus compelling said player to seek a mentoring relationship with all available young players. Mentorocity is often accompanied by a level of Spunkitude and absolutely cannot exist without some level of Veteranicity.

## Historicity ## {#historicity}
The condition of a major league player (although other sports besides baseball apply) who was once a star player (length of time is irrelevant) to retain perceived value far above his quantifiable value for many years after his ability goes super-nova. Very often, said player’s quantifiable worth is replaced by high levels of Veteranicity, Spunkitude, and Mentorocity. It is believed that the easiest way for a player to accumulate Historicity is for him to perform extremely well during the playoffs, and/or hit over .350 for at least one season (see Carlos Beltran and Darin Erstad for recent examples).

## Transitivity ## {#transitivity}
Refers to the perceived value of a player X due to his relationship to another (or group) player. A transitive relationship between two players might range from statistical similarities at a certain age, to handedness, to body build types; all of which are perceived equally valid methods of evaluating future success or failure. Example: Larry Bigbie and Ed Goodson both bat leftie and had similar numbers at the age of 26. Ed Goodson and Paul O’Neil both bat leftie and had similar numbers at the age of 25. Therefore, Larry Bigbie was the next Paul O’Neil.

## El Gurú ## {#el-guru}
The ability of a player to speak Spanish, thus instantly serving as an irresistible draw for other Latin players to join said team.  El Gurú assumes Mentorocity and serves as a thoughtful club-house mate, ready and willing to listen to the deepest desires of latin youngsters and relay their concerns to upper management.  An El Gurú with high levels of Veteranicity is worth his weight in gold.
