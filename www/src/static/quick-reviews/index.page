Books
====

### A Briefer History of Time
I got totally ripped off in high school science class. If I had read this book at age 15 I might have instead chosen to study physics. All children should be encouraged to read this

### Gardens of the Moon

[look here](gardens-of-the-moon.html)

### Grendel by John Gardner
Every once in a while a book comes along that is so beautifully written it shames me to think I should ever consider putting verse to paper. This is one such book. 

### Why I am not a Christian by Bertrand Russell
How does one derive what this book is all about? The formula is actually very simple:

`(( Richard Dawkins + Christopher Hitchens)/2) - Bluster = Bertrand Russell`

This is atheism distilled. 


Graphic Novels
==========

### 28 Days Later: The Aftermath
Worse than goatse.cx fan-fic.

### Safe Area Gorazde
Really bad things happened in Bosnia and dumb-asses like me read about it in a comic book. I shrink in shame.
