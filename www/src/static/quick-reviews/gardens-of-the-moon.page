title: Gardens of the Moon - Book Review

There are very few books [^100pct] that can motivate me to read every single word of text.  
Regardless, I tend to not take points off of a book if I find that I am compelled
to skip a paragraph or two (and in some cases whole chapters).  However, 
there are three classes of books that I find troublesome [^badbooks]:

1.  Slow Start 100
2.  Fast Final 100
3.  Bit part

*[Gardens of the Moon][gotm]* represented all of these classes.  That is, the first 100 pages were difficult reading, and the final 100 were passed over in a fury of speed.  I know many people who love the Malazan series, but I simply cannot see why based on this first installment.  Scratch that; I believe that I know **exactly** why people love this series, that is, many fantasy genre fans adore [world building][worldbuilding].  If you too love world building, then this is a great book for you.  Erickson is an anthropologist by trade, so he well versed in world building, and it shows in excruciating detail.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against world building, but I do not like it to be the central goal of a book -- especially when minor things like characterization suffer as a consequence.  I like my world building to be incidental.

The final reason that I disliked this book is that it read like it belonged to a series.  That is, the author is clearly trying to tell a grand epic, but this goal comes with a cost in that the story seems scattered and not altogther complete.  Perhaps the series as a whole shines, but the first in the series does not stand on its own in my opinion.  I will not, lest I suddenly find myself with a wealth of time, continue the series.

*note*
By my estimation *Gardens of the Moon* has further found success within a certain dubious niche of the fantasy world: the downtime series.  Most of the recommendations that I have come across for the Malazan series have come from fans of George RR Martin's *[A Song of Ice and Fire][asoiaf]* series.  Now, it is my theory that the reason for this is that people are desperate for **anything** that even vaguely smells like GRRM's epic work between installments -- thus lies Malazan.  

-m

[^100pct]: House of Leaves, A Song of Ice and Fire, Chthon, Catch-22, After Dark, Remains of the Day, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and Grendel
[^badbooks]: Another example is called a cdr book.  This is a book that starts off very well, but the rest of the book is garbage.
