Overview
========
Recently I've had to reinstall OSX Panther on my PowerMac because of a weird issue with certain 
pictures (including some toolbar, dock, and menu icons) were being rendered in [Evil Grimace purple][grimacepurple] 
and [Uncle O'Grimacey green][peegreen]. It wasn't a ground breaking issue, but it was annoying and gave me an excuse 
to start from scratch and re-implement The One True Way, which had fallen out of harmony. My One 
True Way is simply my method of setting up a system in a way that makes sense to me. This 
encompasses directory structure, dock/menu usage, symlink creation, script writing, desktop 
background, desktop allocation, program installation, and program configuration. For the most 
part, F1TW (Fogus One True Way&copy;) is virtually identical across platforms except for a few differences in the programs 
installed. This essay describes the approach that I've taken with [OSX][osx] recently while deviations 
for other platforms are highlighted when appropriate.  This essay will continue to evolve [^evolution] over time as 
the F1TW is a dynamic system and not subject to dogmatic conformance to program usage, desktop background,
or company/distro advocacy.  

OS Installation
========================
For any system conforming to F1TW, all hard-drives are first repartitioned and each 
individually formatted and checked for bad blocks. Using the OSX installation disk(s) (as well 
as [Linux][linux] and [Windows][windows]) this is a trivial matter. However, I adhere to a strict 
partitioning scheme for most of my systems, although the details for each differ.

## OSX
1. Partition 0 - OSX System files and home directory.
2. Partition 1 - Vault

## Linux
1. /dev/sda1 - /boot | 2MB
2. /dev/sda2 - /
3. /dev/sda3 - /swap
4. /dev/sda4 - Extended
5. /dev/sda5 - /home
6. /dev/sda6 - /usr
7. /dev/sda7 - /usr/local
8. /dev/sda8 - /var
9. /dev/sda9 - /tmp
10. /dev/sdb1 - /svn
11. /dev/sdb2 - /vault

## Windows
1. Partition 0 - Windows
2. Partition 1 - Mike
3. Partition 2 - [Yuki][yuki]
4. Partition 3 - Vault

The partition scheme above are fairly self-explanatory, however a few exceptions need 
to be explained. First, for all of my systems I like to keep a Vault partition. The vault 
is a repository for essential programs, configuration files, and backups. I usually keep 
a copy of the latest versions of my essential programs (listed below), any periodic backups, 
mirrored copies of all important configuration files (XF86Config, .vimrc, .bashrc, .profile, 
nethack.sav, .emacs, etc...), and a mirror of my source repository. This partition is *always* 
stored on a separate disk from the main OS and is occasionally burned to a disk. The Mike and Yuki 
volumes in Windows are our own sandboxes for to play in.

Once the partitions have been created, formatted, and checked for bad blocks, then the real 
fun begins. I always install from media even though most Linux systems allow for network 
installations -- I like the tactility of physical installation media.

Booting Up for the First Time
======================================
Once the OSes have been installed, it is now time to boot up for the first time and install 
the critical software, or as I like to call it, Ring 0 [^ring0] software. Ring 0 software is generally 
comprised of the following:

## ALL
1. [Bash][bash]
2. [gcc][gcc]
3. [Perl][perl]
4. [Python][python]
5. [Ruby][ruby]
6. [SBCL][lisp]
7. [SSH][ssh]
8. [Apache Server][httpd]
9. [Subversion][svn]

## OSX
1. Software Updates
2. DevTools
3. [MacPorts][macports]
4. X

## Linux
1. Latest C libs
2. [KDE][kde] [^whykde]
3. [FVWM][fvwm]

## Windows
1. Software Updates and Security Patches
2. .NET Framework
3. .NET SDK
4. [Cygwin][cygwin]

Of course before this can be done a network has to be established and all security measures 
must be taken.  I prefer to shut off all ports in and out of Windows to avoid the bite of 
mindless security flaws.  Since I spend very little time in Windows, this is not a problem.  
Likewise, my only Windows machine is actually a virtual machine running inside of VMWare.


Creating Directory Structures
=====================================
After the Ring 0 software has been installed and the system rebooted, it is time to create 
the F1TW sanctioned directory structure. I really despise the way that most system's 
directory structures are laid out. Therefore, I tend to prefer a mish-mash of 
structures that I have concocted/adopted in the past. Currently, my custom structure for my 
home is built as follows:

*    home

    - doc
		+ 	apidoc (stores javadoc, [doxygen][doxygen], and similar documentation locally)
		+ 	tech (manuals, howtos, etc...)
        
    - opt 
		+ 	games
		+ 	music (a symlink to an external device)
		+ 	video
        
    - src
		+ 	minotaur ([project][ariadne] checkouts)
		+	foss (open source source checkouts)
        
    - tmp
		+ 	dl (download directory)
		+ 	void (my own recycle bin)

    - www
		+ 	local (localhost site)
		+ 	mirror (mirrored sites)
		+ 	www (visible to the outside world)


Configuration
======================
Once all of the directories have been set up, it is necessary to set up all programs 
to point to them. For example, in OSX iTunes needs to be informed where the iTunes library is 
located. For this I like to have iTunes copy all added music files to the location and handle 
the directory structure for me. That way I can handle all of the music file tags directly in 
iTunes and have it create the proper tree for them without spending countless hours in doing 
so myself. I would like to have a little more control over the matter, but for the sake of time 
I've decided to ignore the shortcomings in this process. I have a number of scripts written for 
bash-enabled systems (Linux, OSX, Cygwin) that allow me to do platform independent tasks after 
only a few minor changes. For example, I have a [checkin.pl][checkin] script that acts as a front-end hook to 
Subversion and runs a few pre-processors on the source files that I wish to check in (there is also a 
similar [checkout.pl][checkout] script). I also have a [void.sh][void] script that instead of outright removing 
files, it instead copies them into the tmp/void directory. There have been too many occasions 
where I have accidentally deleted important files permanently. During this step I also like to 
copy my custom .bashrc and .bash&#95;profile files which have my own personal settings including 
prompt style, aliases, etc...  Of course my handy-dandy [.emacs][.emacs] file goes into the 
mix.  Finally, I like to setup my [X environment][xconfig] with whatever video card I happen to 
be using at the time.


Program Installation
=============================
Now that my environment is set up, I usually move on to installing the Ring 1 software. 
That is, software that is not essential, but that I really really like to use. This software 
includes:

## ALL
* [Eclipse][eclipse]
* [Emacs][emacs]
* GNU Chess, GNU Go
* [Nasm][nasm] 
* [Ant][ant]
* Java SDK
* [Firefox][firefox] [^firefox]
* [Nethack][nethack] and [DND][dnd]
* [VLC][vlc]
* [Open Office][ooo]
* wget and curl
* VMWare Player
* [Steel Bank Common Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/)

## OSX
* [Quicksilver][qs]
* [OmniGraffle][omni]
* [OmniOutliner][omni]
* [Adium][adium]
* [iTerm][iterm]
* [Burn][burn]
* [HandBrake][handbrake]
* [Delicious Library][delicious-monster]
* [Cyberduck][cyberduck]
* [Colloquy][colloquy]

## Linux 
* [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/)
* Mutt
* [XChat](http://www.xchat.org/)

## Windows
* [7-Zip](http://7-zip.org/)
* [Foxit Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php)
* [Trillian](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/)
* [CDBurnerXP](http://www.cdburnerxp.se/home)
* [EMACS][emacs-win] (Windows-specific binary)
* 

Eye Candy
==================
Once the boring technicalities are out of the way, then the systems can be made to look 
pretty. Usually I choose a solid color background (I tend to like #000051), but 
occassionally I feel fiesty and decide for a picture background. In the past I have 
gone with: Chomsky, Penguins, HAL9000, Giant Robots, Suspiria, DC city-scapes, Destro, 
Turing, Turing Machines, Kolmogorov, Tux, BSD Daemon, Spider Jerusalem, and other things 
that I thought were cool at one point or another.

Finally, the computer is useable.

[^whykde]: I once loved Gnome with a passion, but like all relationships, my love spoiled.  I do not necessarily like KDE, but it is better than the alternative.
[^firefox]: I once loved Firefox with a passion, but my love is now waining.  It has become a fine piece of bloatware sadly.
