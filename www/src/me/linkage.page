## Blogs

### [Trivium](http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/) by Christian Neukirchen

Possibly the only good Tumblog ever created, except for maybe his first (and *the* first -- long since dead).

### [Dadhacker](http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/) by Landon Dyer

Fun stories from the trenches of long-extinct tech wars.[^2]

[^2]: The stories, while long past, should be familiar.  What does that say about our industry?

### [Moonbase](http://moonbase.rydia.net/) by MenTaLguY

Teetering on the brink of extinction, but the archives are gold.

### [Stevie's Blog Rants](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) by Steve Yegge

Iconic.  Sadly infrequent.

### [The Art of Manliness](http://artofmanliness.com/)

Not what you might think.  Tasteful guides for men.

### [Alex Payne's blog](http://al3x.net)

A case-study of humility in blogging.

### [http://nakkaya.com/](http://nakkaya.com/) by Nurullah Akkaya

My absolute favorite Clojure blog.  Top-notch non-Clojure material also.

### [Factor: a practical stack language](http://factor-language.blogspot.com/) by Slava Pestov

Mr. Pestov seems to have been sucked into the Google Vortex, but the archives are platnum.

### [Arcane Sentiment](http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.com/)

Lisp-centric (not exclusively however) blog about various ... uh ... arcane topics.

### [The Blogging of Prolog](http://prologomenon.wordpress.com/) by Victor Lagerkvist

A relatively new blog, but I've loved every post so far.  I miss Prolog.

### [Conal Elliott's blog](http://conal.net/blog/)

I don't often understand this blog, but I strive to.

### [Tony Morris' blog](http://blog.tmorris.net/)

Pushing the limits of Scala and Java's type systems.  Ditto on the understanding and the striving.

### [John Rose's blog](http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/)

Deep dives into all things JVM.

### [Wisdom and Wonder](http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/) by Grant Rettke

Very wide in scope, but always interesting.  Nice links to research, PLT, and Racket abound.

### [Matt Might's blog](http://matt.might.net/articles/)

Probably the blog I'd like to write if I had the skill.

### [Apocalisp](http://apocalisp.wordpress.com/) by Rúnar Óli

Java, concurrency, Scala, type systems... it's all deep and thought-provoking.

### [Kazimir Majorinc's Lisp Notes](http://kazimirmajorinc.blogspot.com/)

Insane (in a good way) NewLisp hacking.

### [Oleg](http://okmij.org/ftp/README.html)

There is no other way to describe this blog.  Mind. Blown. Always.

### [LoperOS](http://www.loper-os.org/) by Stanislav Datskovskiy

This guy hates Clojure, but who cares?  His passion is infectious.

### [The Axis of Eval](http://axisofeval.blogspot.com/) by Manuel Simoni

I rarely agree with Mr. Simoni, but he never fails to make me think.  Great paper links from time to time also.

### [The Racket Blog](http://blog.racket-lang.org/)

The Racket language blows me away.

### [Code Commit](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/) by Daniel Spiewak

Ultimate in Scala hacking... although his concatenative posts are my favorite.

### [One Div Zero](http://james-iry.blogspot.com/) by Jame Iry

Fun and always thoughtful.  I'm not sure if I'm more impressed with his wit or brilliance.  

### [Stuff With Stuff](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/) by (Munificent) Bob Nystrom

Langdev to the max.  The truest example of a language development diary that I've come across.

### [Programming Language Synchronicity](http://olabini.com/blog/) by Ola Bini

Another major entry in the daily (although infrequently updated these days) mind of a language developer.

### [Homoiconic](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic) by Reginald (raganwald) Braithwaite

The pinnacle of thoughtfulness in blogging.  A great mix of wisdom and tech.
