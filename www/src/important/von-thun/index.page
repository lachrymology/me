# The annotated von Thun

I have been a member of the Philosophy Department of La Trobe University since 1972. My PhD topic was on inductive logic,[^il] and I still maintain some interest in the field. Over the years I have taught various courses, in general philosophy,[^philos] philosophy of science,[^sci] philosophy of psychology,[^psy] cybernetics,[^cyb] deductive and inductive logic,[^log] computational logic[^clog] and computer science.[^cs] I retired at the end of 2003, but I am still active in my research, mainly in computer science.

[Symbolic Processing in Pascal](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/phimvt/s00bok.html) contains an unpublished book which is based on several courses I have taught. Programs range from very easy to quite difficult, dealing with parsing, translating, interpreting and some theorem proving. [LLC course](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/phimvt/llc.html)

[The programming language Joy](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/phimvt/joy.html) my research in the design and implementation of a computer language. Joy is a purely functional high level programming language which eliminates lambda abstraction and function application and replaces them by program quotation and function composition.[^c]
