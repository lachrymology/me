** D site
*** FRONT PAGE
**** I love how the navigation squashes down into a top bar and flows down the page. Nice touch.
**** "Let me know" button looks misstyled and misaligned
***** It's below the textbox on my computer
**** <em> text is hard to read
**** I love the word "indelible"
**** One of the big chunky green checkboxes is cut off on the bottom
**** The text to the right of the big chunky checkboxes looks like anchors, but is not
**** The "Participate..." box looks bland -- should stand out more
**** The bottom of the logo and the footer colors are alomst the same thus making the logo look odd
*** COMPONENTS PAGE
**** General dislike of italicized text
**** The body font is too small
**** There is a Siberia of open space to the right of the text
**** First "Download it here" should say "Download Datomic here" and stand out more
**** Omnigraffle images
***** Omnigraffle's default is shadowed elements. I tend to turn it off because it doesn't print well
***** Shadows do not tend to fit with the rest of the page design
***** The line thickness of the Omnigraffle images could use more thickness
**** Second "Download it here" should say "Download the Datomic Developer Appliance here" and stand out more
**** The Siberia of open space could be used for gentle notes on the right
***** Links to AWS
***** Links to VirtualBox
***** Download * Here links
***** etc.
*** RESOURCES PAGE
**** General dislike of italicized text
**** Slightly chunkier fonts would be nice.  Text is quite small.
**** Again, right-side bar could be used for footnotes, links and such
**** Some of the info pages are really really long
**** The source blocks run right up against the text that follows them.
**** GETTING STARTED
***** The bulleted list in the beginning looks misspaced.
**** TUTORIAL
***** The seattle.gov link in the beginning is long and obnoxious
***** "Datomic provides three environments..." table looks weird
***** Inline code elements (e.g. Future<Boolean>, ?e, etc.) should stand out as code
***** Tutorial is *really* long
****** Not bad, it has the right info.
****** Is pagenation in order?
***** If the TBDs are meant to stay, then they should be styled slightly differently.
**** ARCH
***** only general points above apply here
**** DEV APPLIANCE
***** The numbered list looks scrunched up.
***** Could use code styling on the filenames.
**** INTEGRATING PEER
***** only general points above apply here.
**** JAVA SHELL
***** Inline code fragments should look like code.
*** FAQ
**** The question text is huge
**** The answer text is tiny
*** DOWNLOAD
**** A small description of the downloadable packages would be great.
**** I am forced to agree every time I go to the DL page.  Intentional?
