Symbiotic languages
-------------------

* L@@k Fast Ruby by Charlie
* CoffeeScript is #11 on Github, wow
* What other runtimes can we target?

Bandicoot
---------

* Very nice, works against sets
* Relational operators

Elm
----

* FRP
* Inpired by the Kubler-Ross model :-)
* Love the tagged rectangles `[markdown| **bolded**]`
* Flow model similar to Joc:socks
* Values that change over time are Signals (mouse pos)
* `lift` pulls a function into the Signal world

Plan (lisp)
-----------

* Rails-like model of work (planed)
* UNIX model (planned)

Classless
---------

* <http://enumerable.org>
* Shen.clj
* Shen's interop story is weak ATM
* L44k Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari
* L44k David Berry

Datalog
-------

*see someone else's notes*

Roy
----

* typeclasses
* deferred errors
* #a is generic type

Julia
------

* multiple dispatch (Dylan)
  - all args considered.
* @macro calls distinguished wth @
* interacting with data is key
* exploratory programming for an exploratory field
* math ops should be functions
* no static type checks, all types should be declared properly
* started as scheme-based interpreter, moved to llvm

Rust
----

* abstraction penalty
* cost-free penalties: an abstraction that represents a lower-level structure should not cost more than writing out the lower-level structures themselves
* `fmt!` is the macro syntax tag
* @ pointer type lifetimes are scope bound 
  - `shared_ptr<T>`
* & borrow pointers
  - `T&`
* ~ meak pointer types are limited in their ownership
  - `auto_ptr<T>`
* concurrent tasks start with a small stack
  - cheap to make
  - grows as needed
  - individual heaps
* <http://smallcultfollowing.com>
* <http://pcwalton.gitub.com>
* irc.mozilla.org   #rust
* gdb debugging
* L@@k code duplication vs. virtual dispatch

Break
-----

* langzoo.com
  - caerbannog
  - ix
  - treetruncs
  - pl of differing types
  - zeder
* Patagonia
  - drawings
  - contracts
* core.contracts
* trout

Grace
-----

* Smalltalk inspired

Elixir
------

* #elixir-lang on freenode
* no interop cost
* inspired by Clojure
* distributed computation across named processes

Visi
----

* Excel programming 
* L@@k Mesa and Integer spreadsheets
* Improv separated formulas from data
* formula inheritence
* sinks, sources and references
* directly effecting your enivironment
* direct markdown support 
* full type inference
* structural typing line ocaml
