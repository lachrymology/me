                                        <p>With a New Introduction by Benjamin Ferencz, Chief Prosecutor for the United States at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial Originally published three years before the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 1973, this important book was not a polemic, but a sober account of the Vietnam conflict from the perspective of international law. Framed in reference to the Nuremberg Trials that followed the Second World War, it described problems the United States may have to face due to its involvement in the Vietnam conflict. After presenting a general history of war crimes and an account of the Nuremberg Trials, Taylor turns his attention to Vietnam. Among other points, he examined parallels between actions committed by American troops during the then-recent My Lai Massacre of 1968 and Hitler's SS in Nazi-occupied Europe. Commissioned for this edition, Ferencz's introduction evaluates Taylor's study and its lessons for the present and future. When this book was published in 1970, Telford Taylor had concluded that U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam was an American tragedy: "Somehow we failed ourselves to learn the lessons we undertook to teach at Nuremberg." What were those lessons? How acceptable were they? Which laws of war could realistically be enforced on a raging battlefield against an implacable foe? Forty years later, it is worth re-examining how it came about that this powerful and humanitarian country could have come to be seen by many as a giant "prone to shatter what we try to save. -From the Introduction by Benjamin B. Ferencz Telford Taylor [1908-1998] was chief counsel for the prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials. Later Professor of Law at Columbia University, he was a vigorous opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy and an outspoken critic of U.S. actions during the Vietnam War. His books include Sword and Swastika: Generals and Nazis in the Third Reich (1952), Grand Inquest: The Story of Congressional Investigations (1955) and The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir (1992). Benjamin Ferencz, a member of Taylor's legal staff, was the Chief Prosecutor for the United States at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial. He is the author of Defining International Aggression-The Search for World Peace (1975), Adjunct Professor of International Law, Pace University and founder of the Pace Peace Center.</p>

                                        <p>Originally published in 1914, The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists is a timeless story of Socialism, political awakenings and class struggle, told with a volatile mix of heartfelt rage and sly humour. The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists tells the story of a group of working men who are joined one day by Owen, a journeyman-prophet with a vision of a just society. Owen's spirited attacks on the greed and dishonesty of the capitalist system rouse his fellow men from their political quietism. It is both a masterpiece of wit and political passion and one of the most authentic novels of English working class life ever written. This enduring favourite is now reinvigorated by a smart new jacket and exclusive extra material as part of Perennial's Modern Classics line of reissues. Now its timeless message of justice, equality and reason will be introduced to a whole new generation of discerning readers.</p>

                                        <p>"Mark Twain's autobiography is a classic of American letters, to be ranked with the autobiographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Adams.... It has the marks of greatness in it—style, scope, imagination, laughter, tragedy." —From the Introduction by Charles Neider<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Mark Twain was a figure larger than fife: massive in talent, eruptive in temperament, unpredictable in his actions. He crafted stories of heroism, adventure, tragedy, and comedy that reflected the changing America of the time, and he tells his own story—which includes sixteen pages of photos—with the same flair he brought to his fiction. Writing this autobiography on his deathbed, Twain vowed to he "free and frank and unembarrassed" in the recounting of his life and his experiences.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Twain was more than a match for the expanding America of riverboats, gold rushes, and the vast westward movement, which provided the material for his novels and which served to inspire this beloved and uniquely American autobiography.</p>

                                        <p>Hailed as "absorbing" by the New York Times and "suspense-filled" by Foreign Affairs, Patrick Tyler's A Great Wall became an instant classic; a must-read for anyone concerned with the complicated and combative relationship between the world's biggest and the world's most powerful nations. And no one could tell this story better than Patrick Tyler, veteran journalist and former Beijing bureau chief of the New York Times. Using brilliant original reporting from his years in China; interviews with presidents, secretaries of state, Chinese officials, and other key leaders; and 15,000 pages of newly declassified documents, Tyler illuminates a relationship usually shrouded in secrecy, miscommunication, rivalry, fascination, and fear. A Great Wall is essential reading for anyone interested in China and anyone concerned with the shifting dynamics of post-Cold War geopolitics.</p>

                                        <p>A compelling history of the contradictory, often militaristic, role of Zen Buddhism, this book meticulously documents the close and previously unknown support of a supposedly peaceful religion for Japanese militarism throughout World War II. Drawing on the writings and speeches of leading Zen masters and scholars, Brian Victoria shows that Zen served as a powerful foundation for the fanatical and suicidal spirit displayed by the imperial Japanese military. At the same time, the author recounts the dramatic and tragic stories of the handful of Buddhist organizations and individuals that dared to oppose Japan's march to war. He follows this history up through recent apologies by several Zen sects for their support of the war and the way support for militarism was transformed into 'corporate Zen' in postwar Japan. The second edition includes a substantive new chapter on the roots of Zen militarism and an epilogue that explores the potentially volatile mix of religion and war. With the increasing interest in Buddhism in the West, this book is as timely as it is certain to be controversial.</p>

                                            THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW<br />
                                            In this profoundly moving work of epic proportion and intense human sympathy, Abraham Lincoln is observed by his loved ones, his rivals, and his future assassins. In this brilliantly realized, vividly imagined work of fiction, Gore Vidal gives us a portrait of America's great president that is at once intimate and public, stark and complex, and that will become for future generations the living Lincoln, the definitive Lincoln.<br />
                                            "Richly entertaining....For the general reader the elegant explication of the issues of the day gives hearty satisfaction: history lessons with the blood still hot."<br />

                                        <p>"Mr. Vidal demonstrates a political imagination and insider's sagacity equaled by no other practicing fiction writer I can think of. And like the earlier novels in his historical cycle, Empire is a wonderfully vivid documentary drama." —The New York Times Book Review<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In this extraordinarily powerful epic Gore Vidal recreates America's Gilded Age—a period of promise and possibility, of empire-building and fierce political rivalries. In a vivid and beathtaking work of fiction, where the fortunes of a sister and brother intertwine with the fates of the generation, their country, and some of the greatest names of their day, including President McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan, William and Henry James, the Astors, the Vanderbilts, and the Whitneys, Gore Vidal sweeps us from the nineteenth century into the twentieth, from the salvaged republic of Lincoln to a nation boldly reaching for the world.<br />
